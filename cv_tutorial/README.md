Have fun with computer vision!

### Requirements
numpy, cv2, [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/users/installing.html), [jupyter](http://jupyter.org/install.html)

### installing Jupyter using pip
It is recommended to install it with Anaconda.

But if you choose to do it with pip, here is the command.

python 3
```commandline
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
python3 -m pip install jupyter
```

python 2
```commandline
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install jupyter
```

### Usage
`source robo` for windows or `source activate robo` for mac if you are using the environment package(Starter-kit).

`jupyter notebook` or `jupyter notebook tutorial.ipynb` to open the notebook.

There is detailed tutorial for Jupyter notebook as well.

### Error when import plt for mac users
This is caused by different rendering back end of matplotlib.
